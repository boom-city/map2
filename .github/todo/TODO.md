# 1. NEW_REPO list functionality
The `NEW_REPO` list is incorrectly adding all repositories instead of filtering to only include repositories that have not been created yet.

# 2. PUSH_REPOS workflow evaluation
Evaluate whether the PUSH_REPOS workflow is still needed. If it is deprecated, remove it from the codebase.

# 3. Initialize Local repos function validation
The function checks for folder existence but does not validate that the folder contains a valid git repository. The validation should confirm the presence of a git repository (via `git status`, `.git` folder check, or equivalent method). If the folder is missing, the function should return an error.

# 4. Auto-bootstrap repository existence check optimization
The current repository existence check processes repositories individually. Implement a more efficient approach using `gh repo list` and compare against local files for batch validation.

# 5. Remote repository push failure
Investigate and fix the logic preventing successful pushes to newly created remote repositories.

# 6. Scheduled pull workflow removal
Remove the scheduled pull workflow as it is currently non-functional and needs to be disabled.
